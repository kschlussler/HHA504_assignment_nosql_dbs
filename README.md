Assignment for working with managed No-SQL databases

Working with BigQuery was challenging at first as there were several configuration steps to complete. The interface is feature-rich but somewhat overwhelming, and setting up permissions was particularly confusing. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to fully enable all necessary APIs, which prevented me from completing the dataset upload and running the query. The process was more complex than anticipated, and I faced difficulties navigating the various settings and requirements.
